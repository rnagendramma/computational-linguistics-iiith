In goal-1 experiment that is forming the meaningful sentences ,I observed the following functionalities these are:

1.Dropdown menu: From this i was selected one of the language amoung them.This acts like dropdown function.

2.Array/List : These are set of words which are used in forming a meaningful sentence.

3.Reform the sentence button: This function is like reset function it is called when want to reset the sentence.

4.Check the currectness of the sentence: When we click this button it checks the syntax and symantix of the sentence

  that is it displays wether the user forming sentence is currect or not.

5.Get the currect sentence: If the the user formed sentence is wrong then if we click this button then it displays the currect sentence.

 here it acts like Anagram function.

6.Hide the currect sentence: After displaying the currect sentence, when we click this button then it hides the currect sentence.In this it works as

 hide button functionality.
